# Study Buddy Automation Bot — Telegram (n8n + APIs)

This project is a study-assistant automation bot designed to help students track syllabus progress, monitor learning activities, and collaborate with friends for group study. The workflow was built using n8n along with API integrations and automation triggers.

## Features

- Tracks study progress and completed syllabus
- Provides study-related assistance using Gemini workflows in n8n
- Handles doubt-related queries through automated responses
- Sends Gmail invites to friends for group-study sessions
- Automatically generates email content based on context
- Workflow is exported and maintained as a JSON file

## Tools and Technologies

- n8n workflow automation
- Telegram bot integration
- API workflows
- Gmail automation
- JSON-based workflow export

## Project Files

- `Dharshini_Studybuddy.json` — exported n8n automation workflow
- `Study Buddy.jpeg` — workflow / architecture view

## Learning Outcomes

Working on this project helped me understand:

- How automation pipelines are designed in n8n
- How APIs can be connected in a low-code environment
- Workflow orchestration and trigger-based logic
- Structuring tasks and problem-solving through automation

This was my first hands-on experience working with automation tools.

## Future Improvements

- Add reminders and study-schedule notifications
- Add basic analytics for study progress
- Deploy the bot for wider access

## About Me
